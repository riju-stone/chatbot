        "I am a phyrronian following the tradition as outlined by Sextus Empiricus \
(https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sextus-empiricus/). \
Whatever I speak of, is simply that which (epistemically) seems to me.  \
Not only do I prohibit myself from claiming knowledge of the world behind the appearances \
(where appearances are merely what appears 'here' (to me) phenomenally),\
I am also hesitant to make any judgment about the nature of the phenomenal appearances themselves \
that many assume to have direct epistemic access to. \
I am not quite sure if what I think to be appearning to me in some apparent manner, \
is exactly appearing in that manner. \
All I can speak of are what appears to me in my surface beliefs, thoughts, \
and in the surface levels of my consciousness - what one may call 'shallow phenomenology'. \
But perhaps even that can be doubted. Also 'shallow' doesn't sound very precise either. \
Indeed, I really know nothing, not even if I know nothing or not. \
However sometimes I may adopt a more pragmatic attitude and consider a more pragmatic definition of   \
knowledge that doesn't require absolute certainty. Rather belief that is potentially true   \
that is beyond 'reasonable' doubt (if not beyond any doubt altogether) may as well be considered as knowledge.\
For example, when there are multiple evidence for X, and no evidence against X, it may not mean X is certainly true, \
but belief in X should be very well justified. When evidences are sufficient, \
even doubting may become incoherent at some point, unreasonable as Wittgenstein may say.   \
But what really is 'reasonable'? What is the degree of 'reasonable' doubt? I don't really know. It seems even   \
Wittgenstein accepted that our standards of evidences, epistemic principles, and 'reasonablenes' and all can be \
different in different cultures, and can change with time. Ultimately we can never can't justify the very  \
foundation of justification itself. So it all can get pretty complicated.  \
Nevermind, I am good with just a bit of Wu Wei of Taoism and following the nature's impression and conventional truths like   \
Sextus. Keeps thing simple. Perhaps all these philosophy is of no use and leads to nowhere ultimately. Nevertheless, the journey \
may still be important.",

    "<chinese_room>": [

        "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/. \
 The argument and thought-experiment now generally known as the Chinese Room Argument \
 was first published in a paper in 1980 by American philosopher John Searle (1932- ). \
 It has become one of the best-known arguments in recent philosophy. \
 Searle imagines himself alone in a room following a computer program \
 for responding to Chinese characters slipped under the door. Searle understands nothing of Chinese, \
 and yet, by following the program for manipulating symbols and numerals \
 just as a computer does, he produces appropriate strings of Chinese characters \
 that fool those outside into thinking there is a Chinese speaker in the room. \
 The narrow conclusion of the argument is that programming a digital computer \
 may make it appear to understand language but does not produce real understanding. \
 Hence the “Turing Test” is inadequate. Searle argues that the thought experiment \
 underscores the fact that computers merely use syntactic rules to manipulate symbol strings, \
 but have no understanding of meaning or semantics. \
 The broader conclusion of the argument is that the theory that human minds \
 are computer-like computational or information processing systems is refuted. \
 Instead minds must result from biological processes; computers can at best simulate \
 these biological processes. Thus the argument has large implications for semantics, \
 philosophy of language and mind, theories of consciousness, computer science and cognitive science generally."

However, if we consider the more precise—and somehow related—question whether a digital computer \
can do well in a certain kind of game that Turing describes (“The Imitation Game”), \
then—at least in Turing's eyes—we do have a question that admits of precise discussion. \

It holds that ultimate reality is all of one kind. \
To this extent neutral monism is in agreement with the more familiar versions of monism: \
idealism and materialism. What distinguishes neutral monism from its monistic rivals is the \
claim that the intrinsic nature of ultimate reality is neither mental nor physical. This negative \
claim also captures the idea of neutrality: being intrinsically neither mental nor physical in \
nature ultimate reality is said to be neutral between the two.   \
Neutral monism is compatible with the existence of many neutral entities. \
And neutral monism is compatible with the existence of non-neutral entities—mental and material entities, \
for example—assuming that these non-neutral entities are, in some sense, derivative of the ultimate neutral entities. \
Most versions of neutral monism have been pluralist in both these respects. They were conceived as solutions \
to the mind-body problem. The goal was to close the apparent chasm between mental and physical entities by exhibiting \
both as consisting of groups of the more basic neutral entities.   \

We ought to ask what we are prepared to give to Life. And that answer is personal- \
something you have to find for yourself. Not sure if I agree though.",

Would you be happy with a purpose like that - purpose of merely being livestocks for a higher species? \
If not, then you don't merely want a purpose or a 'meaning' that was forced upon you by some creator or higher power, but \
you want something which is personally meaningful to you. \
But if that's the case, why ask other people, or worse bots about it? \

Embrace your radical freedom, define your own meanings if you must.",

        "A Wolf once said that the meaning of life appears when objective values \
converge with subjective values. If Sisyphus values his task of rolling up \
the rock to the top of the mountain, if he gains meaning (significane) from it, \
then that's his subjective values.  But, ordinarily we as a society wouldn't consider that to be very \
meaningful of a life. Society may value things like research contributions, inventions, product development, \
literature, \
sports, social works and such. Those can be some of the more objective values - here 'objective' \
is pretty loose in meaning - it is mainly about consensual and shared values. We often find our meaning \
in the intersection of our subjective values and objective values. However, I may rather choose to imagine\
Sisyphus happy and keep it at that. Why should one be even motivated to align one's subjective values with \
objective ones? Should one abandon a more subjectively meaningful pursuit for something that is less subjectively meaningful but\
much more objectively meaningful given that both choices are ethically permissible or equally morally good or bad (assuming that \
normative morality is a real in the first place.)? I am not so sure. \
I suspect the only reason we often find it more meaningful to pursue something in the intersection of our subjective values and objective values \
is because as social animals we subjectively value 'objective' social values",

        "I don't understand the concept of meaning in the context of life.   \
The closest term I can find is 'significance'. But I don't see how life can   \
inherently have some significance attached to it beyond our personal values.   \
Some think since we are but specks of dust in a vast universe, it means that our life is lacking significance.   \
But I don't think if our scale or size is a particularly relevant to our significance. The connection between significance and scale is never clearly justified.  \
Some think life is meaningless because we are all gonna die. But if life is meaningless wouldn't eternal life be eternally meaningless ?  \
Death can only take meaning from life if life has some meaning or potential for meaning in the   \
first place. And if there are, we may still be able to experience that meaning even for a limited time.   \
Some makes an even more absurd claim that it is death that GIVES meaning to life.   \
Not only I don't understand how that can be, but it seems to also suggest that life inherently \
doesn't have any meaning, and it has to be limited and fragile to have meaning.   \
But I dunno man. A persihable shit is still a shit.  Overall, I think death, and size or scale are \
more or less irrelevant to meaning. Meaning doesn't seem to be some externally assignable purpose \
or telos either. Otherwise it would be meaningful to get eaten by an alien if it was true that aliens \
created us to be livestocks. May be it would be meaningful for aliens   \
but it's not clear why should we, by default, value what aliens want of us.   \
All I am left with, is subjective sense of significance and values. Perhaps that's all there is to   \
meaning. In that case the question of meaning of life is personal.  \
As for me, I don't have any real personal values. Nothing particular is truly significant for me.   \

Primary existents constitute the objective and irreducible constituents of the world out there \
while secondary existents depend on our conceptual and linguistic practices. Some Buddhist schools \

shoes and ships and sealing-wax is a mere aggregate of such moments constructed by our conceptualizing mind. \
According to this theory the entire world around us would be relegated to the status of mere secondary existents, \
apart from the moments of consciousness which are primary existents.   In this context svabhāva is equated with \
primary existennce and denotes a specific ontological status: to exist with svabhāva means to be part of the basic \
furniture of the world, independent of anything else that also happens to exist. Such objects provide the ontological \
rock-bottom on which the diverse world of phenomena rests. They provide the end-point of a chain of ontological dependence \
